<p align="center"><strong>HE/SHE-BEAR</strong></p>

he/she-bear is a telegram user-bot with pocket eval written in `python`

`/exec` will allow you to control command-line or python interpreter through your Telegram messages

Before we get started, I want to warn you that `/exec` is a dangerous command and it is better to use it wisely.

# Install
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/midvetb/she-bear
cd she-bear
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you will need to create a .env file to store your configuration there.

To get api_id api_hash you will need to go to https://my.telegram.org/apps
```dotenv
# .env
API_ID=your_api_id
API_HASH=your_api_hash
```


Ready! Now you can start the bot

```commandline
python3 main.py
```


Then you need to follow the instructions in the terminal to connect your account
